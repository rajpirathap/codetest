2. Can you design a RESTful API for querying these animals?
	option 1
	--------
	We can use spring framework and it's MVC pattern to design and expose a REST API client
	in java. We can define the model classes such as Animal, Bird and other relevant classes
	. Then the service classes exposed to write the business logic behind the scene. 
	Also the controller classes will be defined with the API end points to be called with 
	REST clients. The API response can be exposed in a JSON format which is a universal accepted
	format for REST clients. 
	
	The query parameters can be passed as url parameters or pass through http request body.
	later in controller we can receive those parameters and do further processes.
